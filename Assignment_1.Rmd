# Research Question to Answer with Regression

How does housing tenure and structure affect neighborhood social ties?

# Prior Research

We have identified two studies that show a positive relationship between housing tenure and different measures of social engagement. Levitten-Reid and Matthew (2018), using a sample from Canada, find "a positive association between home ownership and forms of bonding social capital". Similarly, Werner and Klingborg (2010), in s study conducted of Stockholm, Sweden, found results indication that "residents forming tenant-owners associations have more trust in neighbors in the neighborhood."


# Sample Population and Variables

## Continuous Variables
